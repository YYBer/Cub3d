# TO REMEMBER:

// define ERR_FILE "File not found\n" // may not always be that the file isn't found!

# TO DO:
TODO: use ft_error whenever there is an exit call and make it call the same code as when window is closed with mouse or ESC
TODO : leak checks, free correct resources for every 'exit' command (currently it seems MLX42 itself leaks)
TODO : point of view rotation with mouse
TODO : opening/closing doors
TODO : animated sprite
