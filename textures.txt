// textured raycaster principles

// loop in the y-direction is required to go through every pixel to determinate which texel (texture pixel) of the texture should be used for it.
// use a 2D array as screen buffer this time, and copy it to the screen at once
// need extra array for textures
// we already have a screen buffer in the form of mlx->img
// the resize function resizes the array to the give size i.e. 64 x 64 (why don't we just generate the required size for now)
// they generate some textures, which we can also do but need RGB color values
